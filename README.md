# How much do I make?

I wanted to try out couple of instruments and also I had an idea that seeing how much I worked and how much I made would encourage me to work more, procrastinate less and to spend less time on projects like this.

It only works with Teamwork for now, but I also use other platforms so I might add them as well later.

## Development

Requirements: Node LTS, lerna, yarn

Open `ui/web`, copy `.env` to `.env.local` and edit your details. Then go back to project root folder.

```
lerna bootstrap
yarn start
```
